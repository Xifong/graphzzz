- entity leak? :/
    - Seems possible to harass an entity into disappearing
    - Doesn't seem related to smoothing tweens at all (i.e. deleting nodes/edges during these don't cause an issue)
- make fancy smooth mode optional
- ID packing (i.e. nodes and edges should have no missing ids after serialisation)
