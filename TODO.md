- const realPosition = entity.currentPosition(); should probably be reversed straight away
- node deletion race condition
- stop using ! asserts
- refactor NodeObject
- add doc strings to the rest of the utils
- ID packing (i.e. nodes and edges should have no missing ids after serialisation)
- make entities drift faster
